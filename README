###CGFD3D
- Considering that in the domain of earthquake simulation, more accurate models and more efficient computing are equally important, this work employed a novel earthquake algorithm based on the CGFDM and designed a series of dedicated optimizations based on a New-generation Sunway supercomputer. 
The CGFDM inherits the traditional FDM properties of high accuracy and high efficiency. 
Moreover, it meshes grids flexibly according to the geometry of the calculation area. 
Therefore, the CGFDM can resolve the complex topographic effects accurately due to the traction mirror method for free-surface condition.
